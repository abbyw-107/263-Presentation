1. Answers to some basic questions and hypothesis remain unknow because there is no reliable large scale human mobility data.
  // Now we have location-based online social networking application.

2. We will explore: 
  1) geographic movement(Where do we move?) 
  2) temporal dynamics(How often do we move?)
  3) social network(How do social ties interact with movement?
  Later we could build models on these topics
  
3.This could be used for urban planning, human migration patterns and the spread of diseases.

4. Our current plan:
  - Small world properties, visualize the network, show the degree distribution
  - Geographic movement: stop detection, distance distribution, stay time distribution
  - Temporal dynamics: Fraction of stay, number of trips everyday
  
5. What we can really do according to the article:
  - Network analysis (that Abby is working on)
  - Figure 2  (a)(b): We can compare the distance between friends and the distance between all users.
    // Maybe we should use stop detection and clustering to find the home first
  - ??? show the relation between network and movement ???

Mainly work on the data analysis and visualization, not on the modeling part.
