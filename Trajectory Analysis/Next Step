For collaboration analysis:

  1. Select users (maybe around 500)
  
  2. Find home location of users 
      skmob.measures.individual.home_location:
      https://scikit-mobility.github.io/scikit-mobility/reference/individual_measures.html#skmob.measures.individual.home_location
      
  3. Create a dataframe with the following collumn:
      origin    target    origin_homeLocation   target_homeLocation   distance
      
  4. Then we find the relationship between the existance of edges and home distance (the distance distribution)
  
  
  Optional maybe:
  
      Find the trip pattern under the influence of the network
